1. 
    Lidar - pointcloud2, vector3 <x, y, z> 
    Cam - image, rgb values at specific x,y,z 
    Gss - twistedstamped, linear velocity and accelaration
    Gps - latitude and longitude 
    Imu - acceleration and angular velocity
    Yolo - uses the image data and outputs the pixel coordinates triangulation is done on the coordinates of of yolo output and finding the position in the 3d world
    Slam - takes the coordinates of the identified cones and then maps an image, it also takes velocity and other variables for better mapping
    Ppc - takes the map and makes a route to follow for the car and controls the car.

2.
    Interpolating the data
    Creating a buffer 
    Using timestamps to check the lag 
    Creating more efficient algorithms and circuits to reduce the time lag.
