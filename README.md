# Racing Team Trainee Module Assignment Repository
Welcome to the Racing Team Trainee Module Assignment Repository. This repository has been created to store all the assignments given to trainees during their training period.


Each assignment will have its own folder in the repository, with specific instructions and checkpoints to be completed. Trainees should upload their completed work to the corresponding folder.
